         <p>
         Now found <strong>exclusively</strong> at one well-known pizza garden in Gravesend,
         Brooklyn, this style of pizza was once found in neighborhood bakeries.
         This pizza is deceivingly light, crisp, and slightly spicy. Enjoy with a 
         can of soda.

        <li><strong>Combine</strong><p>Combine water and yeast in a small bowl.

        <li><strong>Knead</strong><p>Combine flour and salt together in the bowl of
             a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook attachment. Pour in yeast mixture.

            baking sheet generously with olive oil. Press dough into the bottom. Prick 
            dough all over with a fork. Arrange mozzarella cheese slices over dough; 
            cover with 1 cup sauce. Sprinkle Pecorino Romano cheese on top. Drizzle 
            remaining olive oil over pizza.</p></li>
