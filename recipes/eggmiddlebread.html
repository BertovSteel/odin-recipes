        <p>
            A <em>delicious</em> runny yolk egg cooked in the center of a piece of 
            toast and eaten with a fork is a great way to enjoy an egg in a 
            slightly different way. My kids feel fancy when eating these.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
     <ul>
            <li>Two teaspoons bacon grease</li>
            <li>1 slice of bread</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>Salt and ground black pepper</li>
     </ul>

     <h2>Recipe and Cooking Information</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Prep:</strong> 1 mins</li>
        <li><strong>Cook:</strong> 4 mins</li>
        <li><strong>Servings:</strong> 1</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 1</h3>
    <p>Melt the bacon grease in a non stick fry pan over low heat.</p>

    <h3>Step 2</h3>
    <p>Cut a 1 1/2 to 2-inch hole from the center of the bread slice;
         lay in the hot skillet. When the side facing down is lightly 
         toasted, about 2 minutes, flip and crack the egg into the hole;
          season with salt and pepper. Continue to cook until the egg is 
          cooked and mostly firm. Flip again and cook 1 minute more to 
          assure doneness on both sides. Serve immediately. Enjoy!</p>
